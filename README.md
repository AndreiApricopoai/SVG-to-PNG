# SVG-to-PNG Converter

How to run the project: **python svg.py <svg_file_to_be_converted>.svg**

This project is the final assignment for my Python course at the Faculty of Computer Science. The program is designed to convert SVG files containing the most commonly used elements into PNG image files.

The converter handles a variety of standard SVG elements and ensures accurate rendering in the output PNG files. It demonstrates the use of Python libraries to process and manipulate vector graphics, combining functionality and efficiency in a straightforward tool.
